**###2. Movie Recommendation System**
This project involves building a recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their preferences.

**Algorithm**: Collaborative Filtering
**Tools**: Python, scikit-learn, pandas
**Goa**l: Recommend movies to users based on their watch history.

**###3. Spam Mail Prediction**
This project focuses on classifying emails as spam or not spam.

**Algorithm:** Naive Bayes
**Tools:** Python, scikit-learn
**Goal:** Accurately classify emails as spam or ham.

**###4. HR Analysis**
This project includes various data analysis and visualization tasks performed using R.

**Tools:** Python, scikit-learn   
**Goal:** Perform exploratory data analysis and visualize data insights.

**###5. Car Price Prediction**
This project predicts the price of cars based on various features.


**Algorithm:** Linear Regression
**Tools:** Python, scikit-learn
**Goal: **Predict the price of a car given its features.
